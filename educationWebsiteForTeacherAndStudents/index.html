    Welcome to our class website.  You will complete homework assignments on this website so that you can get immediate feedback and learn from your mistakes.  I will not be able to see your results so this is solely for your benefit in learning the material.  The goal is for you to utlize the feedback to get to the correct answer and learn in the process!
